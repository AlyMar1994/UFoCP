This template is for inconsistencies in FoC.  Inconsistencies, for example, are how every space hero unit is named something different.  E.g.: while Red and Rogue Squadron exist, Vader's squadron is just named Darth Vader instead of Black Squadron, and while Piett is named The Accuser - Captain Piett, Thrawn and Veers are named The Admonitor and General Maximillian Veers instead of The Admonitor - Grand Admiral Thrawn and Blizzard 1 - General Veers.
