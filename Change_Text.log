~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This file lists all changes in both the English and International master text directories.
I'll probably need a better formatting system for this in the future - but currently, all
text changes are stored here.

Unofficial fixes are noted below with a bullet (•).  Bugfixes by Petroglyph will be noted
in the subsequent hotfix's changelog; changes made by the Unofficial Patch will be removed
in tandem and mentioned in the next update.

When fixed, bugs introduced by the Unofficial Patch are included in the next hotfix under
the "UFoCP" header and retroactively edited in the changelog.

Dates, grammar, and times are always in American format.
(i.e. "10-24-2006" = October 24th, 2006, "color" > "colour," "1:52 PM" > "13:52.")

All entries have tags that are accurate to their GitHub report page's URL. Insert the report
number into the below URL to see the original report.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



v2.0.0.#### (##-##-2024) [FoC v1.121.]
============================================

Additions:
• UFoCP now "supports" all standard language texts currently available for FoC (standard langauges: English, French, German, Italian, Spaniard Spanish, Polish and Russian).  Only English and German has translated text for now, other languages have English text ported to the respective language so the text doesn't appear missing.  Japanese isn't supported because that is EaW only; fan patches currently aren't supported (Chinese, Czech-Slovak).
• All indigenous units (and their Consortium Slave counterparts) didn't have customized descriptions like all other units in the game. (BUG #224)
	- A related change, the Noghri description changed for consistency (TEXT_TOOLTIP_NOGHRI_ASSASSIN):
		- ENG: ...They are fierce warriors and assassins. -> ...They are fierce warriors and assassins equipped with disruptor cannons, which are highly effective against everything except shields.
		- GER: ...Sie sind tapfere Krieger und tödliche Attentäter. -> ...Sie sind tapfere Krieger und tödliche Attentäter, die mit Disruptor-Kanonen ausgerüstet sind, die gegen alles außer Schilden sehr wirksam sind.
	- In related change, the Consortium Slave text changed for consistency (TEXT_ENCYCLOPEDIA_TOOLTIP_SLAVE):
		- ENG: An indigenous unit enslaved to the will of the Zann Consortium -> This indigenous unit is enslaved to the will of the Zann Consortium.
		- GER: Ein einheimisches Lebewesen, das vom Zann-Konsortium versklavt wurde. -> Diese einheimische Einheit wird vom Zann-Konsortium versklavt.
• Fix Grand Admiral Thrawn having an unfinished/subpar unit description (TEXT_TOOLTIP_SD_ADMONITOR_02). (BUG #225)
• Fix Captain Piett having an unfinished/subpar unit description (TEXT_TOOLTIP_PIETT_02). (BUG #227)
• Fix General Mohc having an unfinished/subpar unit description (TEXT_TOOLTIP_ARC_HAMMER_02). (BUG #230)
• Fix Tyber Zann's space unit having an unfinished/subpar unit description (TEXT_TOOLTIP_PEACEBRINGER_02). (BUG #239)
• Fix Bossk's space unit having an unfinished/subpar unit description (TEXT_TOOLTIP_HOUNDSTOOTH_02). (BUG #237)
• Fix IG-88's space unit having an unfinished/subpar unit description (TEXT_TOOLTIP_IG2000_02). (BUG #238)


Housekeeping:
• Despite the vast majority of dialogue being double-spaced in EaW (and partially in FoC), dialogue during the Consortium's prologue and campaign wouldn't be.  Double-spacing has been rectified, and remains unmarked in this file to avoid conflicts with changes on the same text keys. (International translations did not suffer this issue, as all dialogue is single-spaced.) (BUG #208).
• Various texts across EaW and FoC would inconsistently use a special "…" (elipsis) character, or "..." (three periods).  The ellipses character is harder to read at high resolutions, and back-and-forth use of ellipses and periods caused spacing issues (f.e. as "to the Empire… .").  All ellipses have been swapped out for three periods and remains unmarked in this file to avoid conflicts with changes on the same text keys. (International translations did not suffer this issue, as three periods are always used.) (BUG #211)
• English localization infrequently referred to the Keldabe-class Battleship as the "Kedalbe," an old spelling from '80s Star Wars material, and German localization almost completely used that spelling.  All instances of "Kedalbe" have been swapped out for "Keldabe," and left unmarked to not clog the changelog. (BUG #236)


International:
• German localization, on occasion, used English names instead of German ones.  Despite much German Star Wars material sometimes using English naming, multiple things in-game that do have official German cognates didn't use them.  The Hound's Tooth wasn't "Reißzahn," the Merciless "Gnadenlos" nor the Accuser "Ankläger," and more.  All known instances have been swapped for their official German cognate from Jedipedia.
