# UFoCP
## Unofficial Forces of Corruption Patch
- Version: v2.0.0.####
- License: The UnLicense (please see License)
---
The Unofficial Forces of Corruption Patch is a one-does-all community patch for Petroglyph Games' 2006 RTS "STAR WARS: Empire at War â€“ Forces of Corruption."  The goal of UFoCP is to correct as many errors as possible to whatever limit is available within Petroglyph's Alamo engine in one convenient package.

You must legally own the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/32470/STAR_WARS_Empire_at_War__Gold_Pack/) updated version of the STAR WARS: Empire at War - Gold Pack to work on UFoCP.  Retail or GOG may work, though they are unsupported[1].

* [1]: "Unsupported," as in: this project is Windows restricted.  The outdated Mac version of the game is unsupported, along with any Linux emulations.  This doesn't mean the patch won't work with those versions, more that there will be no support should anything go wrong.  The current Windows Steam release is semi-frequently updated, and supported with new bugfixes and features from Petroglyph.

## Prerequisities
### Editors
#### Programming
Anything which properly parses [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [XML](https://www.w3.org/xml) will work.  This includes (but not limited to):
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

In addition, plugins that assist with mod development exist (mainly for VSC).  That includes:
- [Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) by sumneko
- [EaW EmmyLua Docs](https://github.com/AlamoEngine-Tools/eaw-emmyluadoc)
- [XML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml) by Red Hat
- [vscode-lua-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Koihik.vscode-lua-format) by Koihik

#### Debugging
The official debugging client was released around 2020, and has been recently updated to handle the new 64-bit Patch.  It's a drag-and-drop set of files for both EaW and FoC that enables console commands, and a variety of logs and debugging features to diagnose game-related problems.  Instructions are included within the download.

#### Mapping
TED maps are Terrain Editor Data modified through the official map editor.  An update was released for it to support the latest Steam version.

Recently, the map editor has again been updated with new bugfixes, and is now completely unlocked.  All developer-mode tools (Cinematics, Paths, etc.) have now been unlocked and is available for Modders on Petroglyph's official website.

#### Modeling
Forces of Corruption and Petroglyph's second game Universe at War uses ALO/ALA 2.0 for models and animations.

When installing the map editor, an Autodesk 3DS Max 8 and 9 version of Petroglyph's official plugin are provided within the game's files.  3DS Max 8 and 9 cannot be aquired legally anymore.  The app itself is also buggy on modern computers, making 3DS Max an unrecommended model editor.

[Gaukler](https://github.com/Gaukler) created a Blender plugin that interprets ALO and ALA effectively, including quality-of-life warnings, and has currently been mainted by [evilbobthebob](https://github.com/andrewfullard).  This plugin DOES NOT support ALA 1.0 included with Empire at War, and will require Mike.nl's animation converter.

- [Animation Converter](https://modtools.petrolution.net/tools/AnimationConverter)
- [ALOViewer](https://github.com/gryttr/alo-viewer)

#### Texturing
Forces of Corruption and the repo works with TGA, DDS, ICO and PNG (with DDS and TGA having advanced transparency settings to work with team coloring and texture blending).  Multiple texture editors exist and will work, but note that Paint.NET is unable to correctly work with the alpha layers of most of FoC's textures.
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
- [Adobe Photoshop - NVIDIA DDS Support](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-exporter)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
- [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)
