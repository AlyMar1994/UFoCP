~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



v2.0.0.#### (##-##-2024) [FoC v1.121.]
============================================

UFoCP:
======
HOUSEKEEPING:
• Template/annotated versions of Empire at War's XML entries have been included under the "_TEMPLATE" folder for documentation purposes/aspiring modders.
• Darth Vader's unit information has been compiled into one file: [Units\Empire\]Units_Hero_Empire_Darth_Vader.xml.
======


Ability Fixes:
• "BARRAGE" prematurely stopped because the ability's invisible targeting marker died in the attack's splash damage; the marker can no longer die in tactical combat. (BUG #1)
• "REMOVE_CORRUPTION_ABILITY" wouldn't appear in GC for Admiral Ackbar, Han Solo & Chewbacca, General Veers, Kyle Katarn, or Mara Jade; the AI also wasn't aware that Ackbar, Darth Vader and Thrawn could remove corruption.  Multiple units weren't defined correctly in the AI/GUI references, and Ackbar's Remove Corruption ability was added to the wrong unit.  While Jade nor Katarn are available in GC, all previously mentioned Remove Corruption abilities have been fully restored. (BUG #35)
• Rebellion Orbital Bombardment (ion cannon bombardment) would be available without ships with ion cannons in orbit (Nebulon-Bs and Alliance Assault Frigates); the Calamari Cruiser and Home One are now the only ships that can orbitally bombard. (BUG #39)
• Cuddles (Silri's rancor) didn't have its eat-infantry ability uncensored in patch 1.121.826596 like indigenous rancor.  Cuddles now also has the same unit exclusions to eat like normal rancor to prevent visual glitches. (BUG #189)
• Hero Clash "Darth Vader vs. Obi-Wan" wouldn't start with Darth Vader's unit in FoC land combat, only his EaW unit. (BUG #26)
• Tyber Zann was a stealth-capable unit in Galactic fleet management despite having a devastating capital ship, even when cloaking technology upgrade wasn't purchased yet.  His stealth ability has been removed for balance, like Aggressor-classes and other heroes, but is still a stealth unit during the Consortium's campaign and prologue. (BUG #154)
• Urai Fen's Cortosis Blades ability couldn't deflect the campaign Force Adepts' lightsabers. (BUG #80)
• Urai Fen's Cortosis Blades ability couldn't deflect Silri's lightsaber whip during Skirmish mirror-matches. (BUG #81)
• Urai Fen's Cortosis Blades ability couldn't deflect Darth Vader's lightsaber in FoC land combat. (BUG #30)


AI Fixes:
• During certain conquering plans, the AI always slept 5 minutes after a victory/failure because of a coding mistake (the scripts couldn't find the player's Difficulty setting); the AI now sleeps for its appropriate cycles: 5 minutes on Easy, 3 minutes 30 seconds on Normal, and 45 seconds on Hard. (BUG #69)
• The AI's blitzkrieg conquering plan "Crush" always cancelled before starting because of a coding mistake (the script couldn't find the player's Difficulty setting); the AI now continues the plan should the Difficulty be set to Hard. (BUG #79)
• AI plans for managing, budgeting wouldn't look for FoC's Death Star II unit. (BUG #53)
• AI plans to upgrade Imperial tech didn't include the Death Star II apart of the list of upgrade objects. (BUG #71)
• AI plans for firing the Death Star wouldn't look for FoC's Death Star II unit. (BUG #51)
• AI plans for building anti-infantry turrets weren't updated from EaW; the AI now knows the Proton Torpedo Turret is the Consortium's designated anti-infantry turret, and now has the same considerations to buy it like the Rebels and Empire. (BUG #114)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in IG-88 nor Garm Bel Iblis when considering buying Repair Facilities. (BUG #117)
• AI plans for finding the nearest appropriate healing object for special units didn't include Darth Vader's unit for FoC land combat, only his EaW unit. (BUG #27)
• AI plans for finding the nearest appropriate healing object for special units didn't include General Veers as a valid recipiant for repairing. (BUG #188)
• Consortium AI plans wouldn't consider buying the Venator-class Cruiser in Space Skirmish because the unit wasn't included in its Skirmish unit table (despite being the only faction able to buy it). (BUG #165)
• Consortium AI plans wouldn't consider building Ysalamiri cages when Darth Vader appears in-battle, as the unit list didn't include Vader's unit for FoC land combat. (BUG #27)
• Consortium AI plans wouldn't consider building Ysalamiri cages when Silri appears in-battle during a Consortium mirror-match. (BUG #187)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in targeting Consortium Repulsorlift Jammers alongside other "tactically active" infrastructure when deciding on structures to attack. (BUG #115)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in Consortium turbolaser towers as artillery to avoid when attacking buildings; Consortium turbolaser towers also weren't a part of the artillery infrastructure list to specifically target. (BUG #116)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in Consortium mobile artillery (MALs), nor any faction's missile defense satellites as artillery to avoid when attacking; they also weren't apart of the artillery infrastructure list to specifically target. (BUG #160)
• The AI's budgeting wouldn't factor in the Consortium's Repulsorlift Jammer as it wasn't apart of their defensive structure list. (BUG #118)
• The Master Force Adept (the Teleporter) in Consortium campaign mission #11 "Raiders of the Lost Holocron" couldn't properly target the player because it referenced a non-existent variable, instead attacking any hostile entity in the area. (BUG #126)
• The Galactic AI had a misspelled variable that prevented reconsidering unit positions every eight seconds as intended; unit movement is no longer irregularly serviced (or not at all). (BUG #130)
• The Galactic AI didn't include Tyber Zann as a possible leader_object for its service to attack planets or find targets. (BUG #140)
• The Galactic AI for what planet(s) heroes like to hang out on when not in use didn't include the Sundered Heart. (BUG #162)
• The Galactic AI for what planet(s) heroes like to hang out on when not in use didn't include Garm Bel Iblis. (BUG #203)
• The Galactic AI for what planet(s) heroes like to hang out on when not in use included an unused version of Captain Piett, and not the proper Star Destroyer. (BUG #204)
• The Galactic AI for what planet(s) heroes like to hang out on when not in use included an unused version of Red Squadron, and not the proper starfighter team. (BUG #205)
• Darth Vader's land assistance AI wouldn't factor in his FoC land unit, only his EaW one, and prematurely shutdown. (BUG #27)
• Han Solo & Chewbacca's galactic planning AI wouldn't factor in avoiding Darth Vader's FoC unit, nor factor in attacking the Death Star II. (BUG #27/53)


Audio Fixes:
• Thrawn's callout for removing corruption would play the Rebels' announcement VO instead of the Empire's. (BUG #12)
• Thrawn's callout for appearing on the battlefield wouldn't play for any faction because the reference was looking for the unused "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn" unit and not "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer." (BUG #24)
• Darth Vader's callouts for appearing on the battlefield would play sporatically, as some of the checks wouldn't look for his FoC land unit, only his EaW one. (BUG #29)
• Tyber Zann's callout for appearing in space battles was awkward as the Underworld announcer claimed "Tyber Zann has landed!"  This callout has been removed. (BUG #59)
• Rogue 4's Derek Klivian wouldn't use either of his very-low-health callouts after becoming leader of Rogue Squadron.  The offending sound entry was misspelled as "...Critcal_Derek_Klivian" instead of "Critical." (BUG #164)
• Consortium turbolaser towers would use the Rebels' VO when built instead of their faction's VO. (BUG #42)
• Consortium Piracy reward ships used their faction-oriented VO when bought and finished construction instead of using Consortium VO. (BUG #50)
• MDUs would use Rebel VO for unit death or building construction.  Each MDU now uses faction-based VO. (BUG #158)
• No music would play when losing against the Consortium because of a bad file reference, and the Consortium's music entries referenced the Rebels'; the Consortium's music now points to its own entries properly (and has had its volume boosted, as the music is quiet). (BUG #31)
• Imperial Force Adepts no longer use both the Rebel blaster SFX and a lightsaber swing sound when attacking. (BUG #63)
• Silri no longer uses both the Stormtrooper blaster SFX and a lightsaber swing sound when attacking. (BUG #207)
• TIE defenders didn't have the "TIE screech" SFX because its unit entry didn't include a fly-by sound definition. (BUG #86)
• TIE defenders' ion cannons sounded and acted like proton torpedoes when used in-battle; this was originally half-fixed in patch 1.121.826596, where they no longer only visually look like torpedoes. (BUG #179)
• Imperial/Rebel hologram advisors wouldn't use special dialogue when the Death Star II was being attacked/defended or attacking/defending because only one entry existed for EaW's Death Star. (BUG #32)
• Consortium hologram advisors wouldn't use special dialogue depending on battle conditions; all conditions were disabled before release, and many were not programmed in at all.  The advisor now comments if Tyber Zann, enemy leaders or the Death Star II are present in battle, and two aditional checks have been added to restore dialogue if IG-88 is present alongside the Death Star II in battle. (BUG #202)
• Consortium advisors would callout that "the Imperials are using a gravity generator!," and used multiple voicelines implying the Consortium destroyed their own Repulsorlift Jammers.  The offending lines have been removed, and only one line remains when the generator is deactivated. (BUG #202)


Interface Fixes:
• Han Solo & Chewbacca's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #92)
• Yoda's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #93)
• Boba Fett's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #94)
• Bossk's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #95)
• Defilers' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #96)
• R2-D2 & C-3PO's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads, and the land team tooltip didn't include any information about the droid pair. (BUG #97)
• Emperor Palpatine's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #98)
• Ewok Handlers' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #99)
• Luke Skywalker's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #100)
• Mara Jade's team tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #101)
• Kyle Katarn's team tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #102)
• Darth Vader's tooltips across the board didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #107)
• Rebel Field Commanders' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #110)
• Imperial Field Commanders' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #111)
• Imperial Force Adepts' tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #112)
• The Governor's Quarters from Consortium campaign mission #6 "Dark Ally" didn't use its unique tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library, instead using the Imperial Prison icon. (BUG #54)
• Guard Towers from the campaign didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #55)
• Reinforcement Points didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #141)
• Shaaks didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #90)
• Tatooine's sarlacc pit didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #155)
• Desert Skettos didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #156)
• Tauntauns didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #157)
• Planets corrupted via Piracy didn't have a corruption icon next to the planet like other corruption types because one was never included in the interface GFX library. (BUG #161)
• The IPV-1 Patrol Craft didn't have a selection ring in combat. (BUG #83)
• Keldabe-class Battleships didn't have the tooltip noting that it can be only built on special planets, like Star Destroyers and Mon Calamari Cruisers. (BUG #143)
• Keldabe-class Battleships, Aggressor-class Star Destroyers, Vengeance Frigates and Interceptor IV Frigates didn't use 1x2 icon tiles like all other ships of their types in the Galactic fleet management window. (BUG #175)
• Interceptor 4 Frigates used the Black Sun rusted pirate frigate icon instead of an icon with the new silver-bodied frigate. (BUG #206)
• Pirate Soldier Mobs used in Consortium campaign mission #6 "Dark Ally" had their tooltip description set as their unit class, and their unit container didn't have a description at all. (BUG #171)
• Jabba's Criminal Empire in the campaign wouldn't display their faction icon on a planet's info window despite having one in the GFX library. (BUG #232)
• The Consortium still used the Black Sun Pirates' faction icon in their economy ledger. (BUG #228)
• The Consortium used Black Sun Pirate unit icons when their planets were attacked without garrisons; the UI now uses their most generic arsenal icon for space and land (StarVipers or Grenadiers, respectively). (BUG #40)
• Consortium capital ships didn't have a unique radar icon like the Rebels' (oval/circle) or the Empire's (triangle) capital ships.  They now use a rectangle based off both ships' forward hull. (BUG #180)
• The Consortium's tech tree window had the space station level requirements for the Aggressor and Keldabe-class swapped, implying Keldabes are bought at station level 4 instead of 5 (and the Aggressor at level 5 instead of 4). (BUG #183)
• The Consortium Soldier/advisor during the prologue "Crime Lord Unleashed" used the Black Sun Pirate hologram instead of the Consortium Soldier hologram.  While I like the aesthetic, unfortunately it's a bug. (BUG #61)
• Right before Darth Vader arrives on Bespin during Consortium campaign mission #7 "Cloud City Conflict," the hologram announcer used the Black Sun Pirate hologram instead of the Consortium Soldier hologram. (BUG #104)



Map/Planet Fixes:
• Space Mandalore's attacking forces would enter facing backwards on the map; the unit entry flags now face toward the space station properly. (BUG #22)
• Space Sullust's planet GFX used the generic desert model instead of the volcanic one; the intended model was misreferenced in the GFX definition, and the map itself used the desert model as a hotfix. (BUG #167)
• Space Aeten II's planet GFX used the generic desert model instead of the volcanic one; the intended model was misreferenced in the GFX definition, and the map itself used the desert model as a hotfix.  For the Piracy mission, Petroglyph reused Mustafar's GFX, leading to further inconsistency. (BUG #167)
• Space Saleucami's orbital defense satellites wouldn't spawn on the map when bought in GC. (BUG #19)
• Space Nal Hutta's moon would be destroyed by the Death Star II, instead of Nal Hutta.  Upon returning to the map, it magically reappeared with Nal Hutta destroyed, because the moon used Coruscant's model.  A new moon entry, "Nar_Shaddaa_Backdrop" (the moon's Legends name) has been added and swapped into the map. (BUG #166)
• Land Tatooine's sarlacc was cut for censorship (i.e. eating infantry alive), but remained uncensored in the Land Skirmish map "Clash on Tatooine."  Petroglyph uncensored the rancor's eat-infantry ability in patch 1.121.826596, therefore consistency the sarlacc has been restored to Tatooine. (BUG #129)
• Land Honoghr had two spots where droidekas would get softlocked because the factories would spawn them into "Steep" terrain and be unable to move. (BUG #77)
• Land Shola would damage Darth Vader because the map's infantry damage script marker didn't include his FoC land unit, only his EaW one. (BUG #27)
• Land Bothawui's intimidation mission had a landing platform that would disappear when the Rebels owned the planet, leaving two floating Gallofree Transports. (BUG #217)
• Land Bothawui's intimidation mission had Rebel Gallofree Transports instead of Imperial Lambda Shuttles when the Empire owns the planet. (BUG #218)
• Land Bothawui's intimidation mission had a group of Bothan guards set to Rebel-only, instead of letting the script handle their faction, leading to the Empire version of the mission lacking a squad of Bothan guards. (BUG #220)
• Jabiim's galactic map model and terrain backdrop used "temperate" GFX despite being tagged as a swamp and appearing as a swamp planet during space combat. (BUG #67)
• Mustafar's galactic map model used the generic volcanic planet GFX instead of the custom blue-glow planet like other planets with custom models.  The original planet model couldn't be used due to LOD states being reversed, so a new W_PLANET_MUSTAFAR_LOW model was created to function on the GC view. (BUG #240)
• Nal Hutta was defined as a swamp planet but with "temperate" terrain; this caused music, GFX and SFX conflicts with the planet's setting.  The campaign/prologue versions of the planet also had the wrong galactic terrain backdrop, showing an ecumenopolis instead of a swamp. (BUG #72)
• Bespin's weather indicator wasn't updated from EaW and didn't have weather conditions on the galactic map; it now has the sun/clear weather icon. (BUG #66)
• Alderaan's weather indicator wasn't updated from EaW and left as "rain" instead of "clear;" the asteroid field was also "temperate" instead of "desert" like Vergesso Asteroids. (BUG #106)
• Honoghr in the campaign would display a generic human instead of a Noghri in its loading screen. (BUG #88)
• Mandalore in the campaign and prologue would display a generic human instead of a Mandalorian in its loading screen. (BUG #89)
• Alderaan would be destroyed in the loading screen for the Land Skirmish map "Alderaan at War."  To rectify this and ensure backwards compatibility with EaW's content, the original Alderaan from EaW was restored under the default "Alderaan" entry, while FoC's Alderaan is recreated as "Alderaan_Destroyed."  All files have been edited to ensure the proper Alderaan appears where it needs to. (BUG #105)


Model Fixes:
• The IPV-1 Patrol Craft had a visible blue plane in its center engine; the plane that spawned the engine particles wasn't set to "Hidden" when exported. (BUG #85)
• TIE defenders didn't have a particle glow for their engines. (BUG #87)
• The Venator-class Cruiser's shielding ability didn't cover the whole ship as the shield model didn't cover large segments of the ship's model, and the ship had incorrect shader assignments.  This was rectified in patch 1.121.826596 for EaW only. (Thanks EaWX-Rhino!) (BUG #137)


Script/Story Fixes:
• Consortium Campaign #7 ("Cloud City Conflict") would spawn the EaW version of Darth Vader instead of the FoC version with the Executor. (BUG #27)
• It was possible to leave the Grenadier's Proximity Mines where Vader and the Stormtrooper meet during Consortium campaign mission #7 ("Cloud City Conflict").  The Stormtrooper would explode and Vader would then walk around destroying mines in the ending cutscene, or both Vader and the trooper would die in the explosion. (BUG #131)
• "Destroy the Death Star" prerequisites for GC wouldn't work because the Empire's faction entry wasn't looking for the Death Star II. (BUG #33)
• Land Bothawui's intimidation mission had guards that lacked the "pointguard" scripting hint, or had it misspelled to "pointguards," meaning the mission script wouldn't function as intended. (BUG #219)
• Land Bestine's kidnapping mission had guards that lacked the "pointguard" scripting hint, meaning the mission script wouldn't function as intended. (BUG #222)


Structure Fixes:
• One of the Pirate Asteroid Base's laser cannon hardpoints wasn't attached station's model in-game, meaning the laser wouldn't fire properly. (BUG #17)
• The Pirate Asteroid Base's hardpoints didn't have damage multipliers against units because its multiplier variables were misspelled, respectively, as "Damage_Sation_Laser" and "Damage_Sation_Turbolaser" instead of "Station." (BUG #119)
• The player couldn't consistently buy the upgrade "Reinforced Durasteel" from the Consortium space station in GC; from station 1-5, the upgrade tiering from Level 1-3 was "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> U/A --> L1."  It now has its ordering from Skirmish: "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> L1 + 2 --> L1, 2 + 3." (BUG #60)


Unit Fixes:
• General Veers didn't have the Imperial hero logo under his AT-AT, unlike other Imperial land heroes. (BUG #49)
• Garm Bel Iblis didn't have the Rebel hero logo under the Gargantuan, unlike other Rebel land heroes. (BUG #122)
• Acclamator-class Cruisers had the laser cannon (anti-fighter) damage multipliers applied to its back-right turbolaser, instead of the turbolaser multipliers. (BUG #25)
• Interceptor IV Frigates had the Acclamator-class laser cannon (anti-fighter) damage multipliers applied to its turbolasers; it now has custom damage multipliers based off of the Acclamator's turbolasers. (BUG #185)
• Crusader-class Gunships didn't originally have damage multipliers, leading to game-breaking damage output in swarms.  This was originally half-fixed in patch 1.121.826596 with one of the testers appending the Corellian Corvette's multipliers to the Crusader's hardpoints.  The Crusader now has its own damage multipliers for finetuning, based off of the Corellian Corvette's. (BUG #190)
• B-wings would use a green laser instead of red when firing, not only unlike all other Rebel ships, but conflicting with its red muzzle flash. (BUG #34)
• B-wings couldn't use one of their ion cannons; their unit entry defined their first ion cannon, HP_BWING_ION_00, twice, and not HP_BWING_ION_01 as well. (BUG #178)
• B-wings were categorized as "Fighter" alongside "Bomber," leading to occasions where the AI would prioritize them as normal starfighters and not bombing units to fill up plan goals.  They now are categorized as "Bomber | AntiFrigate | AntiCapital" like Y-wings. (BUG #181)
• TIE defenders were categorized as "Fighter | AntiBomber" despite being primarily bombers, leading to occasions where the AI would prioritize them as normal starfighters to fill up plan goals.  They now are categorized as "Bomber | AntiFrigate | AntiCapital" like Y-wings. (BUG #182)
• Luke Skywalker would attach to any available capital ships during space battles instead of flying his X-wing. (BUG #70)
• Consortium slaves weren't "victory relevant" like other Consortium infantry.  If only slaves were on the battlefield, the battle would end; the slaves would then reappear on the map fighting for the Consortium if attacked again. (BUG #113)
• Keldabe-class Battleships couldn't be built on Mandalore in the campaign, as the campaign uses a special version of Mandalore named "Mandalore_Story." (BUG #138)
• Aggressor-class Star Destroyers could be built on all planets the Consortium owned if they had a level 4 space station, unlike every other capital ship in the game. (BUG #144)
• Consortium infantry during Skirmish mirror-matches couldn't be bribed by Tyber Zann because the units didn't have a bribe cost attached to them. (BUG #163)
• Imperial infantry wouldn't use their stand-at-attention animation in Darth Vader's "imposing presence" because the animation table didn't include Vader's land FoC unit, only his EaW one. (BUG #68)
• Rebel infantry wouldn't use their celebration animations around Veers' capitulated AT-AT because his unit death models didn't have an "imposing presence" behavior setup, and even if he did, Rebel infantry didn't have his death models included in the animation table. (BUG #47)
• Bossk would permanently contest objects when spawned in his space unit in Skirmish, because the game also spawned an invisible version of his land unit. (BUG #152)
• IG-88 would permanently contest objects when spawned in his space unit in Skirmish, because the game also spawned an invisible version of his land unit. (BUG #151)
• Boba Fett would permanently contest objects when spawned in his space unit in Skirmish, because the game also spawned an invisible version of his land unit. (BUG #149)
• Han Solo & Chewbacca would permanently contest objects when spawned in his space unit in Skirmish, because the game also spawned an invisible version of their land units. (BUG #147)


Upgrade Fixes:
• "Reinforced Durasteel" wouldn't give the Consortium space station a damage reduction in Skirmish or GC; the upgrade only affected Land Skirmish, and only affected defensive satellites. (BUG #14)
• "Modified Cloaking Generator" wouldn't provide a 25% or 50% cloaking time extension for Tyber Zann or the Vengeance Frigate; the upgrade only affected Land Skirmish despite being available for purchase in Space Skirmish. (BUG #15)
• "Recharge Special Abilities" would increase the Consortium's ability recharge times in Land Skirmish, instead of decrease.  The percentage was corrected from "+0.85" to "-0.15." (BUG #173)
• "Salvage" wasn't able to gain salvage from Jabba's Criminal Empire, as their faction reference was misspelled as "Hutt" instead of "Hutts." (BUG #74)
