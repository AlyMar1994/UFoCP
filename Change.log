~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



v2.0.0.#### (##-##-2024) [FoC v1.121.]
============================================

UFoCP:
• HOUSEKEEPING: Darth Vader's unit information has been compiled into one file: [Units\Empire\]Units_Hero_Empire_Darth_Vader.xml.


Ability Fixes:
• "BARRAGE" prematurely stopped because the ability's invisible targeting marker died in the attack's splash damage; the marker can no longer die in tactical combat. (BUG #1)
• "REMOVE_CORRUPTION_ABILITY" wouldn't appear in GC for Admiral Ackbar, Han Solo & Chewbacca, General Veers, Kyle Katarn, or Mara Jade; the AI also wasn't aware that Ackbar, Darth Vader, and Thrawn could remove corruption.  Multiple units weren't defined correctly in the AI/GUI references, and Ackbar's Remove Corruption ability was added to the wrong unit.  While Jade nor Katarn are available in GC, all previously mentioned Remove Corruption abilities have been fully restored. (BUG #35)
• Rebellion Orbital Bombardment (ion cannon bombardment) would be available without ships with ion cannons in orbit (Nebulon-Bs and Alliance Assault Frigates); the Calamari Cruiser and Home One are now the only ships that can orbitally bombard. (BUG #39)
• Urai Fen's Cortosis Blades ability wasn't able to chance deflecting the campaign's Force Adepts' lightsabers, as they weren't included as applicable units. (BUG #80)
• Urai Fen's Cortosis Blades ability wasn't able to chance deflecting Silri's lightsaber whip during Skirmish mirror-matches, as she wasn't included as an applicable unit. (BUG #81)
• Urai Fen's Cortosis Blades ability wasn't able to chance deflecting Darth Vader's lightsaber, as the ability wasn't looking for his FoC land unit, only his EaW unit. (BUG #30)
• Hero Clash "Darth Vader vs. Obi-Wan" wouldn't start because the clash was looking for Darth Vader's EaW land unit, not his FoC unit. (BUG #26)


AI Fixes:
• During certain conquering plans, the AI always slept 5 minutes after a victory/failure because of a coding mistake (the scripts couldn't find the player's Difficulty setting); the AI now sleeps for its appropriate cycles: 5 minutes on Easy, 3 minutes 30 seconds on Normal, and 45 seconds on Hard. (BUG #69)
• The AI's blitzkrieg conquering plan "Crush" always cancelled before starting because of a coding mistake (the script couldn't find the player's Difficulty setting); the AI now continues the plan should the Difficulty be set to Hard. (BUG #79)
• AI plans for building anti-infantry turrets weren't updated from EaW; the AI now knows the Proton Torpedo Turret is the Consortium's designated anti-infantry turret, and now has the same considerations to buy it the Rebels and Empire. (BUG #114)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in IG-88 nor Garm Bel Iblis when considering buying Repair Facilities. (BUG #117)
• AI plans for finding the nearest appropriate healing object didn't include Darth Vader's FoC land unit as a valid recipiant for healing, only his EaW one. (BUG #27)
• AI plans for finding the nearest appropriate healing object didn't include General Veers as a valid recipiant for repairing. (BUG #188)
• Consortium AI plans wouldn't consider building the Venator-class Cruiser in Space Skirmish because the unit wasn't included in its Skirmish unit table (despite being the only faction able to buy it). (BUG #165)
• Consortium AI plans wouldn't consider building Ysalamiri cages when Darth Vader was on the field because the AI was searching for his old EaW unit, not his FoC one. (BUG #27)
• Consortium AI plans wouldn't consider building Ysalamiri cages when Silri is on the field during a mirror-match. (BUG #187)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in Consortium Repulsorlift Jammers alongside other "tactically active" infrastructure to target when deciding on structures to attack. (BUG #115)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in Consortium turbolaser towers as structures to avoid when attacking buildings; Consortium turbolaser towers also weren't a part of the artillery infrastructure list to avoid, or specifically target, altogether. (BUG #116)
• AI plans wouldn't factor in Consortium mobile artillery (MALs), and every faction's space missile artillery as structures to avoid when attacking buildings; they also weren't a part of the artillery infrastructure list to avoid, or specifically target, altogether. (BUG #160)
• The AI's save-or-buy budgeting ignored the Consortium's Repulsorlift Jammer, as it wasn't considered a part of their defensive structure pool and would rarely build it. (BUG #118)
• The Master Force Adept (the Teleporter) in campaign mission #11 "Raiders of the Lost Holocron" couldn't properly target the player because it referenced a non-existent variable, instead attacking any hostile entity in the area. (BUG #126)
• The Galactic AI had a misspelled variable that prevented reconsidering unit positions every eight seconds as intended; unit movement is no longer irregularly serviced (or not at all). (BUG #130)
• The Galactic AI didn't include Tyber Zann as a possible leader_object for its service to attack planets or find targets; he is now properly considered under enemy presence. (BUG #140)
• The Galactic AI for what planet(s) heroes like to hang out on when not in use didn't include the Sundered Heart; if not a part of a conquering plan, he now acts like other heroes. (BUG #162)
• Darth Vader's land assistance AI didn't factor in his FoC land unit and only looked for his EaW version. (BUG #27)


Audio Fixes:
• Thrawn's callout for removing corruption would play the Rebels' announcement VO instead of the Empire's. (BUG #12)
• Thrawn's callout for appearing on the battlefield never played for any faction because the reference was looking for the unused "Grand_Admiral_Thrawn" unit and not "Admonitor_Star_Destroyer." (BUG #24)
• Darth Vader's callouts for appearing on the battlefield would play sporatically, as some of the checks were looking only for his EaW unit and not his FoC one. (BUG #29)
• Tyber Zann's space callout for appearing on the battlefield was awkward as the Underworld announcer claimed "Tyber Zann has landed!"  The callout has been removed. (BUG #59)
• Rogue 4's Derek Klivian wouldn't use either of his very-low-health callouts after becoming leader of Rogue Squadron.  The offending sound entry was misspelled as "...Critcal_Derek_Klivian" instead of "Critical." (BUG #164)
• Consortium turbolaser towers would use the Rebels' VO when built instead of their faction's VO. (BUG #42)
• Consortium Piracy reward ships used their faction-oriented VO when bought and finished construction instead of using Consortium VO. (BUG #50)
• Mobile Defense Units would use Rebel VO for unit death or building construction.  Each MDU now uses faction-based VO. (BUG #158)
• No music would play when losing against the Consortium because of a bad file reference, and the Consortium's music entries referenced the Rebels'; the Consortium's music now points to its own entries properly (and has had its volume boosted, as the music is quiet). (BUG #31)
• Imperial Force Adepts no longer use both the Rebel blaster SFX and a lightsaber swing sound when attacking. (BUG #63)
• TIE defenders didn't have the "TIE screech" SFX because its unit entry didn't include a fly-by sound definition. (BUG #86)
• TIE defenders' ion cannons sounded and acted like proton torpedoes when used in-battle; this was originally half-fixed in the latest patch, where they no longer only visually look like torpedoes. (BUG #179)


Interface Fixes:
• Han Solo & Chewbacca's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #92)
• Yoda's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #93)
• Boba Fett's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #94)
• Bossk's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #95)
• Defilers' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #96)
• R2-D2 & C-3PO's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads, and the land team tooltip didn't include any information about the droid pair. (BUG #97)
• Emperor Palpatine's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #98)
• Ewok Handlers' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #99)
• Luke Skywalker's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #100)
• Mara Jade's team tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #101)
• Kyle Katarn's team tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #102)
• Darth Vader's tooltips across the board didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #107)
• Rebel Field Commanders' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #110)
• Imperial Field Commanders' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #111)
• Imperial Force Adepts' tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads. (BUG #112)
• The Dathomir Governor's Quarters from campaign mission #6 "Dark Ally" didn't use its unique tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library, instead using the Imperial Prison icon. (BUG #54)
• Guard Towers from the campaign didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #55)
• Reinforcement Points didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #141)
• Shaaks didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #90)
• Tatooine's sarlacc pit didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #155)
• Desert Skettos didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #156)
• Tauntauns didn't use a tooltip icon despite having one in the interface GFX library. (BUG #157)
• Planets corrupted via Piracy didn't have a corruption icon next to the planet like other corruption types because one was never included in the interface GFX library. (BUG #161)
• The IPV-1 Patrol Craft didn't have a selection ring in combat. (BUG #83)
• Keldabe-class Battleships didn't have the tooltip noting that it can be only built on special planets, like Star Destroyers and Mon Calamari Cruisers. (BUG #143)
• Pirate Soldier Mobs used in campaign mission #6 "Dark Ally" had their tooltip description set as their unit class, and their unit container didn't have a description at all. (BUG #171)
• The Consortium used Black Sun Pirate unit icons when their planets were attacked without garrisons; the UI now uses their most generic arsenal icon for space and land (StarVipers or Mercenary Infantry, respectively). (BUG #40)
• Consortium capital ships didn't have a unique radar icon like the Rebels' (oval/circle) or the Empire's (triangle) capital ships.  They now use a rectangle based off both ships' forward hull. (BUG #180)
• The Consortium's tech tree window had the space station level requirements for the Aggressor and Keldabe-class swapped, implying you could build the Keldabe at station level 4 instead of 5 (and the Aggressor at level 5 instead of 4). (BUG #183)
• The Consortium Soldier/advisor during the prologue "Crime Lord Unleashed" used the Black Sun Pirate hologram instead of the Consortium Soldier hologram. (BUG #61)
• Right before Darth Vader arrives on Bespin during campaign mission #7 "Cloud City Conflict," the hologram announcer used the Black Sun Pirate hologram instead of the Consortium Soldier hologram. (BUG #104)



Map/Planet Fixes:
• Space Mandalore's attacking forces would enter facing backwards on the map; the unit entry flags now face toward the space station properly. (BUG #22)
• Space Sullust's planet GFX used the generic desert model instead of the volcanic one; the intended model was misreferenced in the GFX definition, and the map itself used the desert model as a hotfix. (BUG #167)
• Space Aeten II & its Piracy mission's planet GFX used the generic desert model instead of the volcanic one; the intended model was misreferenced in the GFX definition, and the map itself used the desert model as a hotfix.  For the Piracy mission, Petroglyph reused Mustafar's GFX, leading to further inconsistency. (BUG #167)
• Jabiim's galactic map model and terrain backdrop used "temperate" GFX despite being tagged as a swamp and appearing as a swamp planet during space combat. (BUG #67)
• Nal Hutta was defined as a swamp planet but with "temperate" terrain; this caused music, GFX and SFX conflicts with the planet's setting; the campaign/prologue versions of the planet also had the wrong galactic terrain backdrop, showing an ecumenopolis instead of a swamp. (BUG #72)
• Bespin's weather indicator wasn't updated from EaW and didn't have weather conditions on the galactic map; it now has the sun/clear weather icon. (BUG #66)
• Alderaan's weather indicator wasn't updated from EaW and left as "rain" instead of "clear" (despite no longer being a planet); the asteroid field was also "temperate" instead of "desert" like Vergesso Asteroids. (BUG #106)
• Honoghr in the campaign would display a generic human instead of a Noghri in its loading screen. (BUG #88)
• Mandalore in the campaign and prologue would display a generic human instead of a Mandalorian in its loading screen. (BUG #89)
• Alderaan would appear blown-up in the loading screen for the Land Skirmish map "Alderaan at War."  To rectify this and ensure backwards compatibility, the original Alderaan from EaW was restored under the Alderaan entry, while FoC's Alderaan is recreated as "AlderaanExploded."  All files have been edited to ensure the proper Alderaan appears where it needs to. (BUG #105)
• The sarlaac on Tatooine was removed from the map for censorship concerns.  It still remained in the Skirmish map, however, and considering the rancor's infantry eating animation was restored in the 2023 patch after being cut for the same reason, the sarlaac has been restored on Tatooine as intended. (BUG #129)
• Land Honoghr had two spots where droidekas would get softlocked because the factories would spawn them into "Steep" terrain and be unable to move properly. (BUG #77)
• The Death Star II would target Nal Hutta's moon because it used a scaled-down version of Coruscant's planet GFX.  The moon would explode, and upon returning to the map, magically reappear with Nal Hutta blown-up.  A new moon entry, "Nar_Shaddaa_Backdrop" (the name of the moon in lore) has been added to rectify the issue and been swapped into the map. (BUG #166)
• Shola would damage Darth Vader in FoC as the map's infantry damage script marker didn't include his FoC unit, only his EaW one. (BUG #27)


Model Fixes:
• The IPV-1 Patrol Craft had a visible blue plane in its center engine; the plane that spawned the engine particles wasn't set to "Hidden" when exported. (BUG #85)
• The Venator-class Cruiser's shielding ability didn't cover the whole ship as the shield model didn't cover large segments of the ship's model, and the ship had incorrect shader assignments. (Thanks EaWX-Rhino!) (BUG #137)


Script/Story Fixes:
• Campaign mission #7 "Cloud City Conflict" would spawn the EaW version of Darth Vader instead of the FoC version with the Executor, etc. (BUG #27)

Structure Fixes:
• One of the Pirate Asteroid Base's laser cannon hardpoints wasn't attached station's model in-game, meaning the laser wouldn't fire properly. (BUG #17)
• The Pirate Asteroid Base's hardpoints didn't have damage multipliers against units because its multiplier variables were misspelled, respectively, as "Damage_Sation_Laser" and "Damage_Sation_Turbolaser" instead of "Station." (BUG #119)
• The player couldn't consistently buy the upgrade "Reinforced Durasteel" from the Consortium space station in GC; from station 1-5, the upgrade tiering from Level 1-3 was "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> U/A --> L1."  It now has its ordering from Skirmish: "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> L1 + 2 --> L1, 2 + 3." (BUG #60)


Unit Fixes:
• General Veers didn't have the Imperial hero identifier under his AT-AT, unlike other Imperial land heroes. (BUG #49)
• Garm Bel Iblis didn't have the Rebel hero identifier under the Gargantuan, unlike other Rebel land heroes. (BUG #122)
• Acclamator-class Cruisers had the laser cannon (anti-fighter) damage multipliers applied to its back-right-most turbolaser, instead of the turbolaser multipliers. (BUG #25)
• Interceptor IV Frigates had the Acclamator-class laser cannon (anti-fighter) damage multipliers applied to its turbolasers; it now has custom damage multipliers based off of the Acclamator's turbolasers. (BUG #185)
• B-wings would use a green laser instead of red when firing, not only unlike all other Rebel ships, but conflicting with its red muzzle flash. (BUG #34)
• B-wings couldn't use one of their ion cannons; their unit entry defined their first ion cannon, HP_BWING_ION_00, twice, and not HP_BWING_ION_01 as well. (BUG #178)
• B-wings were categorized as "Fighter" alongside "Bomber," leading to occasions where the AI would prioritize them as normal starfighters and not bombing units to fill up plan goals.  They now are categorized as "Bomber | AntiFrigate | AntiCapital" like Y-wings. (BUG #181)
• TIE defenders were categorized as "Fighter | AntiBomber" despite being primarily bombers, leading to occasions where the AI would prioritize them as normal starfighters to fill up plan goals.  They now are categorized as "Bomber | AntiFrigate | AntiCapital" like Y-wings. (BUG #182)
• Luke Skywalker would attach to any available capital ships during space battles instead of flying his X-wing. (BUG #70)
• Consortium slaves weren't "victory relevant" like other Consortium infantry.  If only slaves were on the battlefield, the battle would end; the slaves would then reappear on the map fighting for the Consortium if attacked again. (BUG #113)
• Keldabe-class Battleships couldn't be built on Mandalore in the campaign, as the campaign uses a special version of Mandalore named "Mandalore_Story" instead of "Mandalore." (BUG #138)
• Aggressor-class Star Destroyers could be built on all planets the Consortium owned if they had a level 4 space station, unlike every other capital ship in the game. (BUG #144)
• Consortium infantry during Skirmish mirror-matches couldn't be bribed by Tyber Zann because the units didn't have a bribe cost attached to them. (BUG #163)
• Imperial infantry wouldn't use their stand-at-attention animation in Darth Vader's presence because their presence checker was looking for Darth Vader's EaW land unit, not his FoC one. (BUG #68)


Upgrade Fixes:
• "Reinforced Durasteel" wouldn't give the Consortium space station a damage reduction in Skirmish or GC; the upgrade only affected Land Skirmish, and only affected defensive satellites. (BUG #14)
• "Modified Cloaking Generator" wouldn't provide a 25% or 50% cloaking time extension for Tyber Zann or the Vengeance Frigate; the upgrade only affected Land Skirmish despite being available for purchase in Space Skirmish. (BUG #15)
• "Recharge Special Abilities" would increase the Consortium's ability recharge times in Land Skirmish, instead of decrease.  The percentage was corrected from "+0.85" to "-0.15." (BUG #173)
