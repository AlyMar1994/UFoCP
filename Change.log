Fixes made by UFoCP are marked with a bullet (•).  Any fixes made by Petroglyph will be
mentioned and UFoCP's fix of said bug removed.

Bugs introduced by UFoCP that have been fixed will be retroactively edited in the log,
along with a mention to when the bug was fixed, with a new entry.

Dates, grammar and times are always in American format.
(i.e. "10-24-2006" = October 24th, 2006, "color" > "colour," "1:52 PM" > "13:52.")

All (BUG #) markers are accurate to their GitHub URL counterparts.  To visit the main
report, the number itself can be inserted into the URL.

v1.0.1.#### (2022-##-##) [FoC v1.121.786192]
============================================

Ability Fixes:
• "BARRAGE" prematurely ended in multiple cases because the ability's invisible targeting marker kept dying due to splash damage.  The marker has been made invincible to rectify the problem. (BUG #1)
• "REMOVE CORRUPTION" either wasn't functional for Admiral Ackbar, Han Solo & Chewbacca, General Veers, Kyle Katarn, Mara Jade, Darth Vader and Grand Admiral Thrawn, or said units couldn't be used by the AI to remove corruption.  The related AI and GUI references were messed up across the board, Ackbar's ability being implemented on the wrong unit altogether.  While Jade/Katarn can't be used in GC, all previously mentioned units' Remove Corruption abilities have been restored, and the AI should be aware of all applicable units to remove corruption with. (BUG #35)


AI Fixes:
• During certain conquering plans, the AI would always sleep for 5 minutes after a victory/failure because of a coding mistake (the scripts couldn't find the player's Difficulty setting).  The AI was rectified to sleep for its appropriate cycles: 5 minutes on Easy, 3min 30sec on Normal and 45 seconds on Hard. (BUG #69)
• The AI's blitzkrieg conquering plan "Crush" would always cancel before starting because of a coding mistake (the script couldn't find the player's Difficulty setting).  The AI was rectified to properly continue the plan should the Difficulty be set to Hard. (BUG #79)
• The AI's considerations for when to build anti-infantry turrets wasn't changed from EaW.  The Consortium now considers if a friendly build pad is nearby, if a friendly mining facility/resource pad is near the enemy, and now knows the Proton Torpedo Turret is their designated anti-infantry turret. (BUG #114)
• The AI wouldn't factor in the Consortium's Repulsorlift Jammers alongside the other "tactically active" infrastructure to target when thinking about attacking structures. (BUG #115)
• The AI wouldn't factor in the Consortium's turbolaser towers as structures to avoid when attacking buildings.  Additionally, the Consortium turbolaser towers weren't a part of turbolaser infrastructure to target and avoid the firing range of. (BUG #116)
• Even though it's their main source of healing, the AI's prerequisites list didn't include IG-88 nor Garm Bel Iblis as units on the field that can benefit from repair bays when thinking of building them. (BUG #117)
• Since the Repulsorlift Jammer was originally owned by the Empire, the Consortium wouldn't consider the Repulsorlift Jammer as a part of their defensive structure pool, nor would their budgets include the Jammer when figuring out if they should save their money or build up their planets.  The Jammer has been added to both considerations. (BUG #118)


Audio Fixes:
• No music would play when losing against the Consortium because of a bad filename reference.  The Consortium's generic losing music was also referencing the Rebels' music entry.  This has been rectified, and the music had its volume boosted. (BUG #31)


Interface Fixes:
• Han Solo & Chewbacca's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #92)
• Yoda's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #93)
• Boba Fett's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #94)
• Bossk's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #95)
• Defilers' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #96)
• R2-D2 & C-3PO's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not, and the land team tooltip didn't include any information about the droid pair. (BUG #97)
• Emperor Palpatine's GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #98)
• Ewok Handlers' GC tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #99)
• Luke Skywalker's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #100)
• Mara Jade's team tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #101)
• Kyle Katarn's team tooltip didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #102)
• IG-88's tooltips didn't indicate if the unit could capture build pads or not. (BUG #103)


Unit Fixes:
• Whenever Thrawn would remove the Consortium's corruption, it would play the Rebel's announcement VO instead of the Empire's. (BUG #12)


Upgrade Fixes:
• The Consortium space station wouldn't get a damage reduction when buying the upgrade "Reinforced Durasteel" for Skirmish or GC.  The upgrade was set to activate on ground battles, and was set to only affect defensive satellites. (BUG #14)
• The Merciless - Tyber Zann and the Vengeance Frigate wouldn't get an extended cloaking time when buying the upgrade "Modified Cloaking Generator" because the upgrade could only be activated during Land Skirmish, despite only being buyable in Space Skirmish. (BUG #15)
• The player couldn't consistently buy the upgrade "Reinforced Durasteel" from the Consortium space station in GC.  From station 1-5, the upgrade tiering from Level 1-3 was "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> Unavailable --> L1."  It now has its ordering from Skirmish: "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> L1 + 2 --> L1, 2 + 3." (BUG #60)
