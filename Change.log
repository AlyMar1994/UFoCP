~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Fixes made by UFoCP are marked with a bullet (•).  Any fixes made by Petroglyph will be mentioned and
UFoCP's fix of said bug removed.

Bugs introduced by UFoCP that have been fixed will be retroactively edited in the log, along with a
mention to when the bug was fixed, with a new entry.

Dates, grammar and times are always in American format.
(i.e. "10-24-2006" = October 24th, 2006, "color" instead of "colour," "1:52 PM" instead of "13:52.")

All (BUG #) markers are accurate to their GitHub URL counterparts.  To visit the main report, the
number itself can be inserted into the URL.
(i.e. "(BUG #68845)" = https://github.com/AlyMar1994/UFoCP/issues/68845)

v1.0.1.#### (2022-##-##) [FoC v1.121.748742]
============================================

Ability Fixes:
• "BARRAGE" prematurely ended in multiple cases (AT-STs, Broadside/Marauder Cruisers, etc.) because the invisible target marker the ability uses kept dying due to splash damage.  The marker has been made immune to damage to rectify the problem. (BUG #1)


AI Fixes:
• During certain conquering plans, the AI would have a bloated five minute sleep cycle after a victory/failure because of a coding mistake (the scripts could not find the player and evaluate the Difficulty setting).  The AI was rectified to sleep for its appropriate cycles before dropping the plan (5 minutes on Easy, 3min 30sec on Normal and 45 seconds on Hard. (BUG #69)
• During the AI's blitzkrieg conquering plan "Crush," the plan would consistently cancel before starting because of a coding mistake (the script could not find the player and evaluate the Difficulty setting).  The AI was rectified to properly continue the plan should the Difficulty turn out to be set to Hard. (BUG #79)


Unit Fixes:
• Whenever Thrawn would remove the Consortium's corruption, it would play the Rebel's announcement VO instead of the Empire's. (BUG #12)


Upgrade Fixes:
• The Consortium space station wouldn't actually get a damage reduction when buying upgrade "Reinforced Durasteel" for Skirmish or GC.  The upgrade's combat activation mode was wrong (was set to Ground), and was set to only affect defensive satellites. (BUG #14)
• The Consortium space station in Galactic Conquest could not consistently buy upgrade "Reinforced Durasteel."  From station 1-5, the upgrade tiering from Level 1-3 was "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> Unavailable --> L1."  It now has its ordering from Skirmish: "L1 --> L1 --> L1 + 2 --> L1 + 2 --> L1, 2 + 3." (BUG #60)
