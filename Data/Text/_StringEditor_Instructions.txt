Foreword:
AM1994: String Editor and all languages decompiled released for and supported by Forces of Corruption.
Fair warning: NOT ALL .DATs ARE UNIFORM.  F.e., the Polish .DAT has some TO-BE-LOCALIZED ([TBL]) strings
not present in the Russian, English, German, etc. .DATs.  The game doesn't seem to care about this, but
for UFoCP I transferred them all over so, when using the combined .VDF that has all languages, I didn't
have missing strings or invalid errors on exporting.

The provided .VDF already has every .DAT imported and saved.  Changelog format and whatnot in there is
suggestion.  No changes from UFoCP is included.  The provided link to the original download page and
tutorial is recommended.  To easily swap between languages, press ALT+Left Arrow or Right Arrow.  Language
order is GER -> ENG -> FRA -> ITA -> POL -> RUS -> SPA by default and cannot be changed.

To Minimize Corruption:
This editor, in my experience, is notorious for corrupting Data files.  I don't know why.  I don't have the
source nor error logs to know why.  I've gotten corruption for a variety of reasons, whether that be viewing
editing history in the file, adding a new language, etc.  Best advice I have is to keep backups (GitHub) and
make sure to hit "CLOSE" in "File" after save and before exiting the editor (I don't know if this is placebo).

When corruption happens, you'll notice that some of your strings will disappear/have empty Values or their
Keys (the name) will have an orange <!> triangle, and appear at the top of the file.  You can see all "Invalid"
strings by pressing the yellow "Find Next Invalid" button at the top.  The Windows Error SFX means you have no
corrupted strings.  Best you can do is delete the string and re-enter it, or restore from backup.

A common corrupting action is making an edit, saving (new version and everything), exporting, then making
another edit.  When saving/re-exporting, the string you last edited will corrupt.  All strings names will
disappear until you reopen the file.  When reopened, only the last string you edited will be Invalid and
be missing its name.  Retype the name and save, then the file should be fine.
