Fixes made by UFoCP are marked with a bullet (•).  Any fixes made by Petroglyph will be
mentioned and UFoCP's fix of said bug removed.

Bugs introduced by UFoCP that have been fixed will be retroactively edited in the log,
along with a mention to when the bug was fixed, with a new entry.

Dates, grammar and times are always in American format.
(i.e. "06-24-2002" = June 24th, 2002, "color" instead of "colour," "1:52 PM" instead of "13:52.")

All (BUG #) markers are accurate to their GitHub URL counterparts.  To visit the main report,
the number itself can be inserted into the URL.

v1.0.1.#### (2021-##-##) [FoC v1.121.748742]
============================================

Ability Fixes:
• "BARRAGE" prematurely ended in multiple cases (AT-STs, Broadside/Marauder Cruisers, etc.) because the invisible location marker the ability uses kept dying due to splash damage.  The marker has been made immune to damage to rectify the problem. (BUG #1)


Unit Fixes:
• Whenever Thrawn would remove the Consortium's corruption, it would play the Rebel's VO instead of the Empire's. (BUG #12)
